Forest Prototype.

This program demonstrates the prototype design pattern. 
The Foliage class implements Cloneable so that its children can be cloned.
The Forest class uses a hashmap to store one instance of each type of object.
The Forest class also has a cloneFoliage method that creates clones from the hash map
and casts them as Foliage objects.
Tree and Bush are very basic child classes of Foliage.
